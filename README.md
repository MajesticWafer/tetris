# Broken Tetris

My broken Tetris Party clone, fully fledged with bugs!

## About

### Features:

- Soft/Hard dropping
- One-way rotation
- Placement preview

### Versions

There are three versions, `index.html`, `stand-alone.html` and `simple.html`.

The `index.html` uses dependencies (such as Google Fonts), and `stand-alone.html` has the dependencies locally stored. `simple.html` doesn't use any dependencies, so elements like the font will be reverted to default. `simple.html` is reccomended for extremely slow devices that don't deal with the internet well.

### Controls

|-------------|-------------|
| Move left | Left arrow key |
